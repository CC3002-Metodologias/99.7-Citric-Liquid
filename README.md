# 99.7-Citric-Liquid

Base code for CC3002's *99.7% Citric Juice* Project.

The project consists in creating a (simplified) clone of the game **100% Orange Juice**
developed by [Orange_Juice](http://daidai.moo.jp) and distributed by 
[Fruitbat Factory](https://fruitbatfactory.com).

## Game's entities

### Characters

A *character* is the entity that represents the player.

During the game each player controls a different character, with a maximum of 4 players 
and a minimum of 2 for the game to be playable.

Each character has a **name**, **hit points**, **attack**, **defense** and **evasion**.
When a character's hit points reach 0, the character enters a KO status and can't perform
any action until it gets out of that state.
